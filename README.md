# Mongo DB Learning

##  MongoDB Fundamentals

* Allows for multiple databases inside of one instance
  * Not usually used in a single application
  * More for development on multiple applications
* So! We refer to Mongo as our database but also each instance as a database
  * Collection is the unit of data storage in Mongo
    * If you're making an app about Zelda and Fallout, I'd have a collection for Zelda and a collection for Fallout.
      * I'm not going to put the Brotherhood of Steel into my Zelda collection
      * Nor am I going to put the Yiga Clan into my Fallout collection
  * Schema or design of how we'll be storing data

### Core Mongoose/Mongo: 
* CRUD
  * Create
  * Read
  * Update
  * Destroy
